# TerminalGraphingCalculator
A terminal-based, single-variable polynomial function graphing calculator, written in C++

This program implements a variation of the Shunting-Yard algorithm, to convert human written algebraic functions 
into postfix notation. These functions can then be used to create a graph across a domain of values.
